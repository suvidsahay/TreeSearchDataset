You are an expert in evaluating multi-hop question quality. Evaluate the following question based on the {{ num_passages }} passages it was generated from.

CRITERIA (Score 1-5):
1.  **One Clear Question:** Is this a single, clear question, not multiple questions joined by "and"?
2.  **{{ combines_passages_text }}:** Does the question meaningfully require information from ALL {{ num_passages }} passages?
3.  **{{ requires_all_text }}:** Can the question be answered using a smaller subset of the passages? (If yes, score lower).
4.  **Logical Dependency:** Are the facts from the passages logically chained together in a reasoning path?
5.  **HotpotQA-Style Reasoning:** Does the question require complex reasoning across multiple facts, typical of the HotpotQA benchmark?
6.  **Objectivity:** Is the question fact-based and answerable without speculation?
