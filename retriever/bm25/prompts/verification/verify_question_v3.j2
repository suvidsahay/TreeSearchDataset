You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to see which of the generated answers
("Answer A", "Answer B", "Answer Both", "Answer None")
is the closest match to the "Ground Truth Answer".

Question: "{{ question }}"

Ground Truth Answer:
"{{ ground_truth_answer }}"

Generated Answers to Compare:
1. Answer A (from Passage A only): "{{ answer_A }}"
2. Answer B (from Passage B only): "{{ answer_B }}"
3. Answer Both (from both passages): "{{ answer_both }}"
4. Answer None (from general knowledge): "{{ answer_none }}"

Analyze the answers and determine which context was sufficient to produce the Ground Truth Answer.
Respond ONLY with a single valid JSON object.

- Set "Correct_A_passage" to true if "Answer A" is the best and closest match.
- Set "Correct_B_passage" to true if "Answer B" is the best and closest match.
- Set "Correct_2_passage" to true if "Answer Both" is the best and closest match,
  AND both "Answer A" and "Answer B" are clearly inferior or incomplete.
- Set "Correct_no_passage" to true if "Answer None" is the best and closest match.
- If none of the generated answers are a good match, set all flags to false.

Your JSON response (e.g.,
{"Correct_2_passage": true, "Correct_A_passage": false, "Correct_B_passage": false, "Correct_no_passage": false}):
