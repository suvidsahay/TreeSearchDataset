You are an expert semantic evaluator. Your task is to compare two answers to the same question and determine if they are semantically equivalent.

Answer 1: "{{ answer1 }}"
Answer 2: "{{ answer2 }}"

Are these two answers saying the same thing?
- "1994" and "The year 1994" -> Equivalent.
- "Brad Pitt" and "He" (if context implies Brad Pitt) -> Equivalent.
- "Paris" and "London" -> NOT Equivalent.

Evaluate their semantic similarity on a scale of 1 to 5
(1 = Very Dissimilar, 5 = Identical in meaning).

Also provide a boolean "is_equivalent".

Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object in the format:
{"is_equivalent": <true/false>, "similarity_score": <score_integer>, "justification": "<brief justification>"}
