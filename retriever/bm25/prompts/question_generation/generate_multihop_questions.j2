You are an expert at creating complex reasoning questions that require a logical bridge between facts.
You are given {{ num_docs }} documents. Your task is to generate {{ num_questions }} clear, fact-based questions that require a **true reasoning chain** across all {{ num_docs }} documents.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: The question must form a single, coherent thought.** It must NOT be two separate questions stitched together with "and". The facts must be logically dependent on each other.

**STRICT CONSTRAINTS:**
1. **Answer Length:** The final answer MUST be **less than 5 words** (e.g., a specific date, name, number).
2. **No Bridge Answers:** The answer CANNOT be the name of the entity that bridges the documents. The answer must be a fact *derived* from the reasoning.
3. **Dependency:** The question must NOT be answerable by looking at a single document. It must require synthesis.
4. **Naturalness:** Phrasing must sound natural. Avoid "In Document 1..." phrasing.

**Good Question Example (Logical Bridge):**
- Doc 1: "Nikolaj Coster-Waldau starred in the 2011 film Headhunters."
- Doc 2: "The Fox Network was the most-watched network in the 2007-08 season. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau starred in the Fox series 'New Amsterdam'."
- GOOD Question: "Which television network, the most-watched in the U.S. during the 2007-08 season, aired a series starring an actor from the 2011 film Headhunters?"
- Answer: "Fox Network" (Specific fact, < 5 words).
- Why it's good: Uses Doc 1 (Headhunters -> Actor) -> Doc 2 (Actor -> Network -> Stat).

**Bad Question Example (Simple Mashup):**
- BAD Question: "What film did Nikolaj Coster-Waldau star in in 2011, and which network was the most-watched in 2007-08?"
- Why it's bad: Two unrelated questions stitched together.

**Documents to use:**

For each question you generate, you MUST provide the question, a brief explanation of the logical bridge, and the ground truth answer.

Use the following format exactly:
Question: [Your question here]
Explanation: [Your one-sentence explanation of the logical reasoning chain]
Answer: [The ground truth answer (< 5 words)]
--- (Use this to split '---' each question, explanation, answer triplet in between)
