You are a question simplification expert.
We are simplifying a complex question chain by removing one document.

**Original Context:**
- Original Question: "{{ original_question }}"
- Original Answer: "{{ original_answer }}"
- Previously used {{ num_hops + 1 }} documents. We have removed one.

**Your Task:**
Create a NEW question that relies **ONLY** on the {{ num_hops }} documents provided below.
The new question should retain the core topic of the original but must be simpler (requiring exactly {{ num_hops }} hops).

**Documents to Use:**
{{ documents_section }}

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:**
The new question must **Bridge** facts from ALL {{ num_hops }} documents provided above.
- If you write a question that can be answered by Document 1 alone, YOU FAIL.
- If you write a question that can be answered by Document 2 alone, YOU FAIL.
- You MUST combine information (e.g., "The actor from [Doc 1] starred in which movie described in [Doc 2]?").

**Requirements:**
- The question MUST be answerable using only these {{ num_hops }} documents.
- The question MUST NOT imply knowledge from the removed document.
- The answer must be a single fact found in these texts (**less than 5 words**).

Use this format:
Question: [Your new simplified question]
Explanation: [Brief explanation of how it connects the {{ num_hops }} docs]
Answer: [New Answer (< 5 words)]
