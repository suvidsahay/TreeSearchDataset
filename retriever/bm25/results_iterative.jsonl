The series was nominated for an Emmy for Main Title Design. Premise and plot\nJohn Amsterdam (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is an NYPD homicide detective who is 400 years old, but has the appearance of a 35-year-old. He was a Dutch soldier in Manhattan in the year 1642, when he stepped in front of a sword to save the life of a Native American girl during the massacre of her tribe. The girl in turn rescued Amsterdam by weaving a spell that conferred immortality upon him. It was also prophesied that he would not age until he finds his one true love, and only then will he become whole and ready for mortality. Flashbacks in different episodes of the show reveal Amsterdam's centuries of life since, using many names, though usually retaining \"John\", marked by loss as his friends, lovers, children (63), and dogs gradually grow old and die. Amsterdam is a recovering alcoholic who regularly attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, having remained sober since 1965. In his lifetime he has joined the Army three times, in addition to the Coast Guard, Marines, and Navy.

Jaime's twin is Cersei, the Queen of Westeros by her marriage to King Robert Baratheon. Jaime is derisively referred to as \"the Kingslayer\" because he killed the \"Mad King\" Aerys Targaryen in the coup that put Robert on the Iron Throne. Eric Dodds of TIME described Jaime as \"handsome, an incomparably skilled fighter, and disarmingly witty\". The New Yorker called the Lannisters \"a crowd of high-cheekboned beauties ... who form a family constellation so twisted, charismatic, and cruel that it rivals Flowers in the Attic for blond dysfunction\". Lev Grossman wrote for TIME that while Jaime and Cersei's younger brother Tyrion is a grotesque dwarf, \"the rest of the Lannisters are stunted too, but on the inside.\""}, {"title": "Nikolaj Coster-Waldau", "text": "Nikolaj William Coster-Waldau ([\u02c8ne\u031dko\u02ccl\u0251j\u02c0 \u02c8k\u02b0\u028cst\u0250 \u02c8v\u00e6lt\u0251w]; born on 27 July 1970) is a Danish actor.

Jaime's twin is Cersei, the Queen of Westeros by her marriage to King Robert Baratheon. Jaime is derisively referred to as \"the Kingslayer\" because he killed the \"Mad King\" Aerys Targaryen in the coup that put Robert on the Iron Throne. Eric Dodds of TIME described Jaime as \"handsome, an incomparably skilled fighter, and disarmingly witty\". The New Yorker called the Lannisters \"a crowd of high-cheekboned beauties ... who form a family constellation so twisted, charismatic, and cruel that it rivals Flowers in the Attic for blond dysfunction\". Lev Grossman wrote for TIME that while Jaime and Cersei's younger brother Tyrion is a grotesque dwarf, \"the rest of the Lannisters are stunted too, but on the inside.\""}]}
