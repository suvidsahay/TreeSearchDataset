His work was distinguished for its high production values, complex harmonies and orchestrations, vocal layering, and introspective or ingenuous themes. He was also known for his versatile head voice and falsetto. Wilson's formative influences included George Gershwin, the Four Freshmen, Phil Spector, and Burt Bacharach. In 1961, he began his professional career as a member of the Beach Boys, serving as the band's songwriter, producer, co-lead vocalist, bassist, keyboardist, and de facto leader. After signing with Capitol Records in 1962, he became the first pop musician credited for writing, arranging, producing, and performing his own material. He also produced acts such as the Honeys and American Spring. By the mid-1960s he had written or co-written more than two dozen U.S. Top 40 hits, including the number-ones \"Surf City\" (1963), \"I Get Around\" (1964), \"Help Me, Rhonda\" (1965), and \"Good Vibrations\" (1966). He is considered the first rock producer to apply the studio as an instrument and one of the first music producer auteurs. Facing lifelong struggles with mental illness, Wilson had a nervous breakdown in late 1964 and subsequently withdrew from regular concert touring to focus on songwriting and production. This resulted in works of greater sophistication, such as the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and his first credited solo", "player, as Wilson's bodyguard, trainer, and caretaker. A family intervention involving the band's lawyers and accountants was arranged to remind Wilson of his contractual obligation to write and produce for the Beach Boys. According to Stan, Wilson's growing resentment had led him to frequently announce his withdrawal from the Beach Boys, but his bandmates persisted. Although Stan improved Wilson's health over several months, he soon returned to his NBA commitments. Wilson entered psychologist Eugene Landy's intensive 24-hour therapy program in October. Under Landy's care, Wilson stabilized and became more socially engaged, renewing his productivity. In 1976, the slogan \"Brian's Back!\" was widely used to promote the Beach Boys' concert tours and the July release of 15 Big Ones, the first album since Pet Sounds to list Wilson as the sole producer. Recording sessions were tense, as his bandmates opposed his proposal for a covers album and questioned his readiness to lead studio proceedings. The album ultimately featured a mix of covers and original material. Beginning on July 2, 1976, Wilson resumed regular performances with the band for the first time since 1964, singing and alternating between bass guitar and piano. In August, he toured outside California for the first time since 1970. NBC premiered a Lorne Michaels\u2013produced television special, titled The Beach Boys, featuring recent concert footage, interviews, and a comedy sketch with Wilson alongside NBC's Saturday Night cast members Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. Despite the promotional success of \"Brian's Back!\", the campaign was controversial. Wilson's remarks in interviews", "many unresolved until the early 2000s. Wilson's productivity had increased significantly after his disassociation from Landy. He and Andy Paley composed and recorded a substantial body of material intended for a proposed Beach Boys album throughout the early to mid-1990s. Concurrently, Wilson collaborated with musician Don Was on the documentary Brian Wilson: I Just Wasn't Made for These Times (1995), whose soundtrack\u2014comprising rerecorded Beach Boys songs\u2014was released in August as his second solo album. In 1993, Wilson agreed to record an album of songs by Van Dyke Parks, which was credited to the duo and released as Orange Crate Art in October 1995. In the late 1990s, Wilson and Tony Asher rekindled their writing partnership, and one of their songs, \"Everything I Need\", appeared on The Wilsons (1997)\u2014a project by his daughters Carnie and Wendy that included select contributions from Wilson. Imagination and formation of the Brian Wilson Band Although some recordings with the Beach Boys were completed, the Wilson\u2013Paley project was eventually abandoned. Instead, Wilson co-produced the band's 1996 album Stars and Stripes Vol. 1 with Joe Thomas, owner of River North Records. In 1997, Wilson relocated to St. Charles, Illinois, to work on a solo project with Thomas. His third solo album, Imagination (June 1998)\u2014which he described as \"really a Brian Wilson/Joe Thomas album\"\u2014peaked at number 88 in the U.S. and received criticism for its homogenized radio pop sound. Shortly before the album's release, Wilson lost his brother Carl and their mother Audree. Some reports from this period"], "passage_2_candidates": ["Love & Mercy is a 2014 American biographical drama film directed by Bill Pohlad about the Beach Boys' co-founder and leader Brian Wilson and his struggles with mental illness during the 1960s and 1980s. It stars Paul Dano and John Cusack as the young and older Wilson, respectively, with Elizabeth Banks as his second wife Melinda Ledbetter and Paul Giamatti as his psychologist Dr. Eugene Landy. The title comes from Wilson's 1988 song of the same name. The film alternates between Wilson's production of the album Pet Sounds (1966) and his treatment under Landy's 24-hour therapy program in the late 1980s. Wilson called the film \"very factual\", despite containing parts that \"weren't actually as factual\". He had little involvement with its making, although Ledbetter was relied upon for the 1980s portions. The cast and crew maintained that nothing in the film was a \"Hollywood\" embellishment and that everything was intended to be as truthful as possible. Conversely, Landy's son Evan felt that his father was unfairly portrayed. Some minor inaccuracies were noted by critics, a number of which relate to the minimal coverage devoted to Wilson's family and collaborators. Ledbetter said that Landy's treatment of Wilson \"was even worse\" than the film portrays. Love & Mercy premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2014 and was released by Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions on June 5, 2015. It grossed $28.6 million over a $10 million budget and received positive reviews from critics, with Dano's performance garnering significant", "to the Beach Boys' songs without their consent. This timeline ends with Wilson apathetic and detached from life. In the 1980s, an older and heavily medicated Brian Wilson meets Melinda Ledbetter, a Cadillac saleswoman. She begins a relationship with him, but is disturbed by the controlling influence Wilson's therapist and legal guardian Dr. Eugene Landy has over Wilson's life. Eventually, she disengages from the relationship, but not before, with help from Wilson's housekeeper Gloria Ramos, providing evidence to Wilson's family that Landy has been made a beneficiary in his will. This leads to a restraining order being taken out to prevent Landy from seeing Wilson, who begins a new and more appropriate course of treatment. A few years later, Wilson bumps into Ledbetter again while walking across an intersection. They eventually marry, and Wilson completes Smile as his own solo album. Cast Production Pre-production A theatrical film adaptation of Wilson's life, titled Love and Mercy, was first proposed in 1988, and was planned to star William Hurt as Wilson and Richard Dreyfuss as Landy. It derived its title from Wilson's single, \"Love and Mercy\" (1988), which appeared as the opening track to his debut solo album Brian Wilson. While the project stagnated in development hell, the Beach Boys were eventually featured as the subject of two made-for-TV dramatizations: Summer Dreams: The Story of The Beach Boys (1990) which was widely derided for their historical inaccuracies and The Beach Boys: An American Family (2000) which Brian Wilson harshly criticized. Rolling Stone", "The Story of The Beach Boys (1990) which was widely derided for their historical inaccuracies and The Beach Boys: An American Family (2000) which Brian Wilson harshly criticized. Rolling Stone reported in 1999 that Melinda hoped to organize a Wilson biopic which starred Jeff Bridges. In 2006, the Wilson biopic project was briefly revived, and was to have included involvement from producers Mark Gordon, Lawrence Inglee, Jordan Wynn, and David Leaf. Nothing further was reported. As film producer/director Bill Pohlad cultivated an obsession with the 1997 box set The Pet Sounds Sessions, he became interested in Brian Wilson's life while eventual producers John Wells and Claire Rudnick Polstein were attempting to make a Beach Boys film. Love & Mercy is the second feature directed by Pohlad\u2014decades from his previous\u2014and was financed with his own money. After the film was formally announced on June 23, 2011, information about it remained relatively scarce until its unveiling in September 2014. Writing Pohlad deemed the original script he received (titled Heroes and Villains, after the Beach Boys' song) unsatisfactory, and so he enlisted writer-director Oren Moverman, who had previously found success with the impressionistic Bob Dylan biopic I'm Not There (2007), which Pohlad believed was \"an admirable effort ... [but] went too far\". Pohlad claimed that Love & Mercy drew significant interest from \"pretty big people in all parts of the business ...

During one interview session, the Landy line seemed to ring every thirty minutes. Yet Brian appears to be a willing participant in the program.\" Even though the Beach Boys had hired Landy, part of the regimen involved cutting Wilson's contact from the group, as Landy reasoned: \"You can't deal with people who only want to use you.\" Wilson said that \"Dr. Landy doesn't like me to be in touch with my family too much. He thinks it's unhealthy.\" For example, Brian remembered participating in an interview with his brother Carl Wilson, \"and the interviewer asked Carl what it was between him and me. He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't have to talk to each other. We're just Beach Boys, but we don't need to be friends.' And that's true. Although, whenever I think about him, I feel rotten.\" In 1986, Wilson met his future wife and manager Melinda Ledbetter, a Cadillac saleswoman and former model, while browsing through a car dealership. Six months after meeting Wilson, she had reported Landy to the state's attorney general, who informed her that nothing could be done without the cooperation of Wilson's family. Ledbetter felt that the family had been at their \"rope's end\" with Wilson, and that they did not know what to do to help him. She said that three years into their relationship, Landy ordered Wilson to sever ties with her.

Landy's regimen involved supervising and micromanaging his client's life with a team of counselors and doctors. His most notable patient was the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson, with whom he formed a business and creative partnership in the 1980s. Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Landy aspired to show business as a teenager, working odd jobs as a radio producer, and was an early manager to guitarist George Benson. During the 1960s, Landy studied psychology, earning his doctorate at the University of Oklahoma. After moving to Los Angeles, he treated many celebrity clients, including musician Alice Cooper and actors Richard Harris, Rod Steiger, Maureen McCormick, and Gig Young. Brian Wilson became a patient of Landy's program in 1975. Landy was discharged within a year due to his burdensome fees. In 1982, Landy was re-employed as Wilson's therapist, subsequently becoming his executive producer, business manager, co-songwriter, and business adviser. Landy co-wrote and co-produced Wilson's first two solo projects, Brian Wilson (1988) and the unreleased Sweet Insanity (1990), and allegedly ghostwrote portions of Wilson's first memoir Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story (1991). In 1989, the state of California revoked Landy's professional license amidst accusations of ethical violations and patient misconduct. Although Landy ceased to be Wilson's psychologist on legal record, Landy continued to act as Wilson's business partner until a 1992 restraining order barred Landy from contacting", "next two years. An August 1988 board meeting with the Beach Boys had Landy promising that Brian would reconnect with the group, which Love says: \"was a ruse to get us to write a letter in his defense against the California authorities. We never wrote the letter, and Brian's public behavior continued to unsettle.\" Landy and his colleagues said that his treatment of Wilson ended in February 1988 at the request of the state attorney general's office, but the deputy attorney who drafted the complaint reported that he was not aware of any such request, nor was the office advised that they sever Landy's relationship with Wilson. Co-producers of Wilson's solo album said they witnessed no changes, and Landy's assistants remained with Wilson. Sol Samuels said this was because Landy had little direct involvement with Wilson's treatment, and that it was instead the people Landy hired who continued to regulate Wilson's medication. Conservatorship hearings Peter Reum, a therapist who met Wilson while attending a Beach Boys fan convention in 1990, was alarmed by Wilson's demeanor and speculated that he might have tardive dyskinesia, a neurological condition brought on by prolonged usage of antipsychotic medication. Reum phoned noted Beach Boys biographer David Leaf, who then reported Reum's observations to Carl Wilson.

{"claim": "Led Zeppelin is a band.", "passage_1_candidates": ["Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The band comprised vocalist Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist-keyboardist John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham. With a heavy, guitar-driven sound and drawing from influences including blues and folk music, Led Zeppelin are cited as a progenitor of hard rock and heavy metal. Among the best-selling music artists of all time, they influenced the music industry, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock and stadium rock. Led Zeppelin evolved from a previous band, the Yardbirds, and were originally named \"the New Yardbirds\". They signed a deal with Atlantic Records that gave them considerable artistic freedom. Initially unpopular with critics, they achieved all-but-unmatched commercial success with eight studio albums over ten years. Their 1969 debut, Led Zeppelin, was a top-ten album in several countries and features such tracks as \"Good Times Bad Times\", \"Dazed and Confused\" and \"Communication Breakdown\". Led Zeppelin II (1969), their first number-one album, includes \"Whole Lotta Love\" and \"Ramble On\". In 1970, they released Led Zeppelin III which opens with \"Immigrant Song\". Their untitled fourth album, commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV (1971), is one of the best-selling albums in history, with 37 million copies sold. It includes \"Black Dog\", \"Rock and Roll\" and \"Stairway to Heaven\", with the latter being among the most popular and influential works in rock. Houses of the Holy (1973) includes \"The Song Remains the Same\" and \"The Rain Song\". Physical Graffiti (1975), a double album, features \"Trampled Under", "way rock concerts were managed and presented to huge audiences. In 2007, they were a featured artist in the stadium rock episode of the BBC/VH1 series Seven Ages of Rock. The band have sold over 200 million albums worldwide, according to some sources, while others state that they have sold more than 300 million records, including 111.5 million certified units in the United States. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Led Zeppelin are the third-highest-selling band, the fifth highest selling music act in the US, and one of only four acts to earn five or more Diamond albums. They achieved eight consecutive number-ones on the UK Albums Chart, a record for most consecutive UK number-one albums shared with ABBA. Led Zeppelin remain one of the most bootlegged artists in the history of rock music. Led Zeppelin had cultural impact. Jim Miller, editor of Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll, argues that \"on one level, Led Zeppelin represents the final flowering of the sixties' psychedelic ethic, which casts rock as passive sensory involvement\". Led Zeppelin have also been described as \"the quintessential purveyors\" of masculine and aggressive \"cock rock\", although this assertion has been challenged. The band's fashion-sense has been seminal; Simeon Lipman, head of pop culture at Christie's auction house, has commented that \"Led Zeppelin have had a big influence on fashion because the whole aura surrounding them is so cool, and people want a piece of that\". Led Zeppelin laid the foundation for the big", "reunion, and were described as the \"greatest rock and roll band of all time\".

History Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, Led Zeppelin made numerous concert tours of the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe in particular. They performed over 600 concerts, initially playing small clubs and ballrooms and then, as their popularity increased, larger venues and arenas as well. In the early years of their existence, Led Zeppelin made a concerted effort to establish themselves as a compelling live music act. As was recalled by bass player John Paul Jones: [Led] Zeppelin was a live band and that's how we got our reputation. The press hated us in the early days. Our only way of promotion was to play a lot of live shows, especially in the UK. It used to spread by word-of-mouth. However, though the band made several early tours of the UK, the majority of Led Zeppelin's live concerts were performed in the United States, which was settled on as the primary foundation for their fame and accomplishment. In 1969, for example, all but 33 of the band's 139 shows were performed in the U.S., and between the years 1968 and 1971 they made no fewer than nine tours of North America. \"It felt like a vacuum and we'd arrived to fill it\", guitarist Jimmy Page once told journalist Cameron Crowe. \"It was like a tornado, and it", "of their studio albums. Led Zeppelin also performed at several music festivals over the years, including the Atlanta International and the Texas International Pop Festivals in 1969, the Bath Festival of Blues in 1969 and the next one in 1970, the \"Days on the Green\" in Oakland, California in 1977, and the Knebworth Music Festival in 1979. Characteristics Led Zeppelin's reputation as a compelling live act is often attributed to the tight understanding and musical chemistry achieved between all four group members, combined with a shared willingness to try new things on-stage, which resulted in dynamic, unpredictable performances. As is noted by Led Zeppelin archivists Dave Lewis and Simon Pallett: Led Zeppelin live was an extraordinary animal. From the very beginning no two performances were alike. Such was the creative spark between the four that the basic structures of their songs were repeatedly reworked, extended and improvised on, making their studio counterparts almost unrecognisable. Led Zeppelin have been described as the kind of group that actually rehearsed on stage, experimenting with the reaction of the audiences to new material and letting the pieces mature through the live experience. Several tracks from their albums were debuted on stage well before their official release on vinyl. Jimmy Page himself has said that most of the band's songs were designed for live performance. Every show we did was different. You never knew when you went onstage what you might do by the end of it ... Once a song was recorded, and it", "tours of North America. \"It felt like a vacuum and we'd arrived to fill it\", guitarist Jimmy Page once told journalist Cameron Crowe. \"It was like a tornado, and it went rolling across the country.\" After touring almost incessantly during its early years, Led Zeppelin later limited its tour appearances to alternating years: 1973, 1975, 1977 and 1979. From the early 1970s, the commercial and popular drawing power of Led Zeppelin was such that the band began to embark on major stadium tours which attracted vast crowds, more than they had previously performed to. During their 1973 tour of the United States, they played to 56,800 fans at Tampa Stadium, Florida, breaking the record set by The Beatles at Shea Stadium in 1965. Similar crowds were drawn on Led Zeppelin's subsequent U.S. tours, and they continued to break attendance records (on April 30, 1977 they played to 76,229 fans at the Pontiac Silverdome, Michigan, a world record attendance for a solo indoor attraction). It is for these reasons that Led Zeppelin, as much as any other band or artist in this era, is credited for helping to establish what has come to be known as stadium rock. Many critics attribute the band's rapid rise as much to their tremendous appeal as a live act as they do to the quality of their studio albums. Led Zeppelin also performed at several music festivals over the years, including the Atlanta International and the Texas International Pop Festivals in 1969, the Bath Festival"], "passage_3_candidates": ["\"Stairway to Heaven\" is a song by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, released on 8 November 1971 on the band's untitled fourth studio album (commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV), by Atlantic Records. Composed by the band's guitarist Jimmy Page with lyrics written by lead singer Robert Plant, it is widely regarded as one of the greatest rock songs of all time. The song has three sections, each one progressively increasing in tempo and volume. The song begins in a slow tempo with acoustic instruments (guitar and recorders) before introducing electric instruments. The final section is an uptempo hard rock arrangement, highlighted by Page's guitar solo and Plant's vocals, which ends with the plaintive a cappella line: \"And she's buying a stairway to heaven\". \"Stairway to Heaven\" was voted number three in 2000 by VH1 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Rock Songs\", in 2004 Rolling Stone magazine ranked \"Stairway to Heaven\" number 31 on its \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list. It was the most-requested song on FM radio stations in the United States at the time, despite never having been commercially released as a single in the US. In November 2007, through download sales promoting Led Zeppelin's Mothership release, \"Stairway to Heaven\" reached number 37 on the UK Singles Chart. Writing and recording The song originated in 1970 when Jimmy Page and Robert Plant were spending time at Bron-Yr-Aur, a remote cottage in Wales, following Led Zeppelin's fifth American concert tour. According to Page, he", "1971, in front of a live studio audience, and broadcast three days later on the BBC. The song was performed at almost every subsequent Led Zeppelin concert, only being omitted on rare occasions when shows were cut short for curfews or technical issues. The band's final performance of the song was in Berlin on 7 July 1980, which was also their last full-length concert until 10 December 2007 at London's O2 Arena. When playing the song live, the band would often extend it to over 10 minutes, with Page playing an extended guitar solo and Plant adding a number of lyrical ad-libs, such as \"Does anybody remember laughter?\", \"And I think you can see that\", \"wait a minute!\" and \"I hope so\". For performing this song live, Page used a Gibson EDS-1275 double neck guitar so that he would not have to pause when switching from a six to a 12-string guitar, while John Paul Jones used a Mellotron to replicate the sound of the woodwind instruments he used on the studio recording. By 1975, the band was using the song as its finale in concert. However, after their concert tour of the United States in 1977, Plant began to tire of \"Stairway to Heaven\": \"There's only so many times you can sing it and mean it...It just became sanctimonious.\" The song was played again by the surviving members of Led Zeppelin at the Live Aid concert in 1985; at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert in 1988, with Jason", "so dumb?\" Robert Plant expressed frustration with the accusations in a 1983 interview in Musician magazine: \"To me it's very sad, because 'Stairway to Heaven' was written with every best intention, and as far as reversing tapes and putting messages on the end, that's not my idea of making music.\" Accolades (*) designates unordered lists.
