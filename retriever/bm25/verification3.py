Evaluate the following question using the SIX criteria below. For each one, give a score from 1 to 5 and one short explanation at the end.

Before you score the question, here are FIVE EXAMPLES with their scores and justifications to guide you:

---

‚úÖ Strong Example  
Question: What roles did Peter Dinklage and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau play in Game of Thrones, and what awards did they receive?  
Scores:  
  - clear_single_question_score: 5  
  - combines_passages_score: 5  
  - requires_both_score: 5  
  - logical_dependency_score: 5  
  - hotpot_style_score: 5  
  - objectivity_score: 5  
Justification: This question is clearly phrased, meaningfully combines facts about both actors and their awards, and requires reasoning across passages to construct the answer. It is grounded in the texts and structured in HotpotQA style.

---

üü° Moderate Example  
Question: How did the visual branding of Fox during the late 1990s coincide with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's early career in the United States?  
Scores:  
  - clear_single_question_score: 5  
  - combines_passages_score: 5  
  - requires_both_score: 5  
  - logical_dependency_score: 4  
  - hotpot_style_score: 4  
  - objectivity_score: 5  
Justification: This question links two timelines and references both documents. However, the passages do not contain any explicit or inferred connection between branding and career, making the logical link weaker. It‚Äôs clear and well-structured, but lacks answerability.

---

‚ùå Weak Example (Irrelevant Passage Reference)  
Question: How does Peter Dinklage‚Äôs role in ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù relate to his role in ‚ÄúX-Men: Days of Future Past‚Äù?  
Scores:  
  - clear_single_question_score: 5  
  - combines_passages_score: 2  
  - requires_both_score: 2  
  - logical_dependency_score: 2  
  - hotpot_style_score: 1  
  - objectivity_score: 5  
Justification: Only one passage discusses ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù; the other does not mention ‚ÄúX-Men‚Äù at all. While the question is clear, it lacks grounding in both passages and fails to require reasoning or comparison across them.

---

‚ö†Ô∏è Weak Example (Side-by-Side Facts Without Connection)  
Question: Which major mountain range in Slovenia is part of the country's seismic zone, and what year did Slovenia join the Eurozone?  
Scores:  
  - clear_single_question_score: 5  
  - combines_passages_score: 3  
  - requires_both_score: 3  
  - logical_dependency_score: 2  
  - hotpot_style_score: 2  
  - objectivity_score: 5  
Justification: While this question refers to both passages, the two facts are not logically related. They are placed side by side without reasoning or conceptual connection. This weakens both the dependency and HotpotQA style.

---

‚ö†Ô∏è Weak Example (Superficial Passage Mention)  
Question: What is the population of Chad's capital, N'Djamena, which is relevant to understanding the scale of social issues that Ryan Gosling addressed during his work in Chad?  
Scores:  
  - clear_single_question_score: 5  
  - combines_passages_score: 2  
  - requires_both_score: 2  
  - logical_dependency_score: 2  
  - hotpot_style_score: 1  
  - objectivity_score: 5  
Justification: This question tries to force a connection between Chad‚Äôs demographics and Gosling‚Äôs charity work, but the Gosling passage contains no meaningful data about Chad‚Äôs population or issues. This results in shallow cross-passage use.

---

Now evaluate the following question using the same criteria:

Score Guide:  
1 = Very Poor  
2 = Poor  
3 = Average  
4 = Good  
5 = Excellent

Criteria:  
1. One Clear Question (No ‚Äúand‚Äù): Is this a single clear question, or does it combine two separate questions with ‚Äúand‚Äù?  
2. Combines Facts from Both Passages: Does the question require information from BOTH passages?  
3. Neither Passage Alone Is Enough: Can the question be answered using just one passage? (If yes, score lower.)  
4. Logical Dependency: Are the two facts logically connected, or just listed side-by-side?  
5. HotpotQA-Style Reasoning: Does the question require reasoning across multiple facts like HotpotQA?  
6. Objectivity and Speculation: Is the question based on facts from the documents, or does it ask for speculation?

Return your answer as a valid JSON object in this exact format:
